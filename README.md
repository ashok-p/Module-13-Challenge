# Module-13-Challenge - Venture Funding with Deep Learning
This application utilizes the knowledge of machine learning to create a binary classifier model using a deep neural network that will predict whether an applicant will become a successful business.

The Starter Code was provided along with the historical applicant data.

---

## User Story
Alphabet Soupâ€™s (a venture capital firm) business team receives many funding applications from startups every day. This team has asked you to help them create a model that predicts whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

The business team has given you a CSV file containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. The CSV file contains a variety of information about each business, including whether or not it ultimately became successful.

## Acceptance Criteria  
The application must meet the following acceptance criteria:  

* Pre-process the data for it to be used by the neural network model.
* Build a binary classification model using a neural network.
* Evaluate the performance of the model
* Optimize the neural network model by trying several strategies

## The Application  

The application follows these stages: 

### Pre-Process the Data for Use on a Neural Network Model

1. Read the `applicants_data.csv` data from the `Resources` folder into a Pandas DataFrame.
2. Review the dataframe and identify the categorical data that needs to be encoded. 
3. Drop the EIN and NAME columns.
4. Use `OneHotEncoder` method to encode the categorical columns and save the **encoded** data in a separate dataframe.
5. From the original DataFrame extract the **numerical columns** and add to the **encoded** dataframe.
6. Create the **Features (X)** and **Target (y)** datasets, with the Target being the **IS_SUCCESSFUL** column and the Features, the rest.
7. Split the data into training and testing datasets by using `train_test_split`.
8. Use `StandardScaler` to scale the Features dataset.

### Build a Binary Classification Model Using a Deep Neural Network
Use Tensorflow and Keras to build a deep neural network.
1. **Create** a Deep Neural Network by choosing number of hidden layers, assigning number of neurons to each hidden layer, number of features and output neurons 
2. **Compile** the model using `binary_crossentropy` loss function, the `adam` optimizer and the evauation metric of `accuracy`
3. **Fit** the model with the scaled training features data, target training data and `epochs` set to 50.

### Evaluate the Model

1. `Evaluate` the trained model with the test Features and Target datasets.
2. Save the model to a `HDF5` file.
3. Save the performance results in a `results` dataframe. 
4. Display the `results` dataframe

### Optimize the Deep Neural Network Model
Repeat the above steps of creating, compiling, fitting and evaluating by tuning one or more of the following:
* changing the number of layers
* changing the number of neurons in each layer
* dropping feature columns
* changing the loss function 
* changing activation functions 
* changing number of epochs

### Performance Report 
After 15 tries, tuning various parameters listed above reached the conclusion that it was difficult to improve the performance above accuracy of 73% with a minimum loss of 55% while using 'binary_crossentropy', and mean squared error (mse) and respective loss of 18% when the loss function of 'mean_squared_error' was utilized.

The details of the results are summarized in results_df dataframe, which can be viewed by [clicking here](performance_report.png)

## Installation Guide
Following are the instructions to install the application from its Github respository.  

### Clone the application code from Github as follows:
copy the URL link of the application from its Github repository      
open the Terminal window and clone as follows:  

   1. %cd to_your_preferred_directory_where_you want_to_store_this_application  
    
   2. %git clone URL_link_that_was_copied_in_step_1_above   
    
   3. %ls     
        Module-13-Challenge    
        
   4. %cd Module-13-Challenge     

At this point you will have the the entire application files in the current directory as follows:

    * README.md                       (this file that you are reading)  
    * performance_report.png          (model performance report
    * GC_venture_funding_with_deep_learning.ipynb         (the application jupter lab notebook)  
    * Resources                      (Folder with the data required) 
        - applicants_data.csv

## Usage
The following details the instructions on how to run the application.  

### Setup Google Colab to run the application (on Mac computers)


   5. click on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) - an IDE that allows you to run Jupyter Notebooks in the cloud. You can also copy and paste the link https://colab.research.google.com/ in your web browser as an alternative. 
    
   6. click on **upload** 
    
   7. click on **Choose File** to select the notebook **GC_venture_funding_with_deep_learning.ipynb** from the folder in Step 4 above 

---

#### Run the Application 

After the notebook **GC_venture_funding_with_deep_learning.ipynb** has loaded, click on **Runtime** tab and select **run all**  

After uploading all the required libraries, the notebook will be waiting for you to input the Resource file name.   
From the Resources folder in Step 4 above select the **applicants_csv** file and press enter 


### Setup the environment to run the application (on Windows)
This application was run only on a Mac Computer. However, if you wish to run it on a Windows machine, you will have to remove all the Colab references in the beginning where you upload the files in the notebook and then run the program as follows.  I have no way of testing on Windows, so didn't attempt to change the code.

Setup the environment using conda as follows:

    5. %conda create dev -python=3.7 anaconda  
    
    6. %conda activate dev  
    
    7. %jupyter lab  

---

#### Run the Application
THIS ASSUMES FAMILIARITY WITH JUPYTER LAB. If not, then [click here for information on Jupyter Lab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).  

After step 7 above, this will take you to the jupyter lab window, where you can open the application notebook **GC_venture_funding_with_deep_learning.ipynb** and run the application.  

**NOTE**:
>Your shell prompt will look something like __(dev) ashokpandey@Ashoks-MBP dir%__ ,  with:  
    - '(dev)' indicating the activated 'dev' environment,   
    - ' ashokpandey@Ashoks-MBP ' will be different for you as per your environment, and   
    - 'dir' directory is where the application is located.  
    - '%' sign is the shell prompt - it may be a dollar sign in your implementation
